I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Madras School of Economics, Chennai, India. I work primarily in the area of Environmental Economics, focusing on issues relating to climate change. I have been trained as an economist. However, my research interests are mostly interdisciplinary in nature. Iam a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Madras, Chennai for my thesis titled *Economic Analysis of CLimate Change Impacts and Adaptation in Indian Agriculture* which aims to assess the physical impacts historical of weather sensitivity of rice crop and estimate the costs of adapting to climate change.
