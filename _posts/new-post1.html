<p>The present document details the notes that I have prepared as I proceed to analyze the NSS Education Survey data.</p>
<p>Let’s import the dataset and order some variables first.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. use "D:\Data\NSS\Education\stata\Merged_data\block1_7_lbl.dta", clear

. order hhid Sl_No_informant Hhsize, before(Person_SN)
</pre>
<p>Now examine the enrollment stuatus of the eligible (Age 3-35) population</p>
<pre class='stata'>. tabulate Enrollment_status_3_35, matcell(x)

Status of enrolment: For age 3-35 years │      Freq.     Percent        Cum.
────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────
                        never enrolled  │     27,816        9.71        9.71

enrolled in current academic year and c │      1,161        0.41       46.59
                    currently attending │    152,992       53.41      100.00
────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────
                                  Total │    286,456      100.00
</pre>
<p>We have total of <code>152,992</code> individuals who are currently attending. Let’s create an indicator variable <code>current_attend</code> to examine how many of the eligible population are attending currently and those who are not currently attending.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. //indicator: currently attending or not
. recode Enrollment_status_3_35 (4 = 1) (1/3 = 0), gen(current_attend)
(286456 differences between Enrollment_status_3_35 and current_attend)

. label define current_attend 1 "yes" 0 "no"

. label values current_attend current_attend
</pre>
<p>Let’s also create a variable <code>ever_enroll</code> to indicate how many of the elibigle population ever enrolled.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. //indicator: ever_enrolled
. recode Enrollment_status_3_35 (2/4 = 1) (1 = 0), gen(ever_enrolled)
(286456 differences between Enrollment_status_3_35 and ever_enrolled)

. label define ever_enrolled 1 "yes" 0 "no"

. label values ever_enrolled ever_enrolled
</pre>
<p>Let’s examine the information contained in these two newly created variables, viz., <code>current_attend</code> and <code>ever_enroll</code> and compare them with the information on individuals’ relation with the head of the households.</p>
<p>So we run the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>tab Relation_head current_attend</code></pre>
<pre class='stata'>                      │       RECODE of
                      │ Enrollment_status_3_3
                      │     5 (Status of
                      │  enrolment: For age
                      │      3-35 years)
     Relation to head │        no        yes │     Total

               self-1 │    15,099      2,628 │    17,727 
     spouse of head-2 │    20,239        196 │    20,435 
      married child-3 │    15,438        633 │    16,071 
spouse of married chi │    18,297        620 │    18,917 
    unmarried child-5 │    51,428    119,473 │   170,901 
         grandchild-6 │     7,508     25,585 │    33,093 
father/mother/father- │         1          0 │         1 
brother/sister/brothe │     5,103      3,673 │     8,776 
servants/employees/ o │       350        182 │       532 
──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼──────────
                Total │   133,463    152,990 │   286,453 
</pre>
<p>From the above table we see that nearly <code>78</code> (=119473/152990) percentage of the currently enrolled population is an <code>unmarried child</code> of the household head. Similarly, we see that nearly <code>39</code> (=51428/133463) percentage of the currently <strong>not</strong> enrolled population is an <code>unmarried child</code> of the household head.</p>
<p>If we consider only the currently enrolled population, then <span class="math inline">∼</span> <code>95</code> percent of the population are either <code>unmarried child</code> or <code>grandchild</code> of the household head. Thus for the currently enrolled population alone, we can try to recover the <code>parental education</code> and related information.</p>
