There was some struggle for me to choose the first post for my blog. Then I thought, it better be about academic writing, particularly, science and scientific writing. <span id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</span> I am aware that science writing is only a part of 'academic writing'. Present-day scientific writing mimics current thinking in science in general and science publishing in particular. I find it problemmatic for reasons to be discussed later in this post.

Science publication is a specific type of 'academic writing'. In no way does the former is fully represents the latter; academic writing can have both scientific fervour as well as an artistic appeal. Academic writing has its own element of science, that defines it as a reason-driven form of communication.

However, as you may have realized by now, Science is in demand.

I recently read an article on '[How can we boost the impact of publications?](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/2/341)' publised in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*.

Highly cited articles have been termed as `influential` articles. These are articles that are

1. Short
2. Uses first person narration - I
3. Placed findings in context by providing a setting
4. Linked ideas using conjunctions, punctuation marks and using consistent terminology
5. Avoided excessive acronyms and awkward noun chunks
