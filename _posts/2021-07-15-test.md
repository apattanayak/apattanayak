There are a number of reasons why we should be looking into this posts. Before I give you these reasons, let me talk a bit about myself.

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Madras School of Economics, Chennai, India. 
I work primarily in the area of Environmental Economics, focusing on issues relating to climate change. 
I have been trained as an economist. My research interests are mostly interdisciplinary in nature. 
I received my Ph.D. Degree in Economics from the University of Madras, Chennai for my Doctoral thesis titled **Economic Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation in Indian Agriculture** which aims to assess the physical impacts of historical weather sensitivity of rice crop and estimate the costs of adapting to climate change.
